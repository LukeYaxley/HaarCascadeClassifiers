# Face Detection with OpenCV

Face Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to detect faces in both static images and real-time webcam input using the Haar cascade classifier. The provided script processes images to detect faces and highlight them with rectangles.

## Features
- Detects faces in static images.
- Detects faces in real-time from a webcam feed.
- Highlights detected faces with red rectangles.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (opencv-python)
