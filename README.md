# Haars Cascade Clasification 
Implementation of Haar Cascade Classifiers as a  part of the Computational Intelligence Module. A Haar Cascade Classifier is a machine-learning object detection method to identify objects in images or video. It is based on the Haar-like features concept and the cascade training technique. Viola and Jones introduced the method in their seminal paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.
